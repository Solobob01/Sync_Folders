For help:
    python3 ./main.py --help

How to run:
    python3 ./main.py --src {source_folder_path} --repl {replica_folder_path} --p {loop_time(in seconds)} --log {log_file_path}
    The file paths should be : {file_path} or ./{file_path}

There is also a test command:
    make run_test (it uses the src and replica created in this folder and a period of 5 seconds)

First it clears the replica folder and the log file so we can work in a clear enviroment
Inside the loop it checks for differences between the replica folder and the source folder every p seconds
    First we deleted the files that are in the replica folder but not in the source folder
    After that we check for new files/folders inside the source folder and update them/copy them in the replica folder
    During the copy of a file, a md5 hashing is used to check if there is not difference between the copied file and the original one
